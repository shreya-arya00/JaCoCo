Code coverage is a measure of how much of your source code is executed during automated tests. A higher code coverage percentage indicates that more of your code is being tested, reducing the likelihood of undiscovered bugs. Jacoco is a widely used code coverage tool that helps measure and visualize code coverage in Java applications.
